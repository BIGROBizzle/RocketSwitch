# RocketSwitch
RocketSwitch is a custom program which overwrites a default Rocket League map with your custom map file.

# Features
* Set and forget folder configuration for easy boot and use.
* Easily overwrite levels and play them.
* Quickly restore back to default maps for online play. 
* Save map, click Switch button, load or reload the overwritten map without restarting Rocket League.

# Important!! 
Backup your the default maps before doing anything else!!
When starting RocketSwitch you must first set the rocketleague\TAGame\CookedPCConsole folder by clicking the top folder button and browsing to it. Click 'Save Config' button. Next click 'Backup Maps' on the top navigation bar. You will see it's progress at the bottom. When finished you can save your map with the suffix '_P.upk' (MyMap_P.upk) to the custom map folder and begin overwriting any map in the list. To overwrite click on your custom map, then click on a default map like 'Labs_Underpass_P.upk' then click 'Switch Selected Maps' button.

# Known Bugs
If your map doesn't show up in the list, but it is in the correct folder you can either restart the program or reset the folder using the button. Will implement fix if I find time :)
